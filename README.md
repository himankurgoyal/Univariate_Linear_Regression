# Univariate_Linear_Regression

Task 1 : Exploring Supervised Machine Learning

1) This model is well designed to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 
2) This is a simple Univariate Linear Regression Problem with the help of important python libraries followed by the reading of the text data file using pandas.
3) I have implemented the Linear Regression Algorithm on the given dataset. 
4) I have done some data exploration with data visualization to know the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
5) I have divided the given dataset into two parts 20% test dataset & 80% trained dataset.
5) The evaluation has been done on the test dataset which results in good accuracy and less mean square error. 
6) This model was trained efficiently and was able to predict the right values when feed with further new DataSet.
